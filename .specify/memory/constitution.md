# Project Constitution

## Non-Negotiable Principles

### 1. Spec-Driven Development
- All features must be specified before implementation
- Specifications take precedence over implementation preferences
- Any deviation from specifications must be documented and justified

### 2. Code Quality
- Follow clean code principles
- Write self-documenting code
- Maintain consistent code style
- Include appropriate error handling

### 3. Testing
- Write tests for all features
- Maintain high test coverage
- Tests should be clear and maintainable

### 4. Documentation
- Document all architectural decisions
- Keep specifications up to date
- Maintain clear README and code comments

### 5. User Experience
- Prioritize user experience and usability
- Ensure responsive design
- Provide clear feedback for user actions

### 6. Performance
- Optimize for performance
- Consider scalability
- Minimize resource usage

## Technology Standards

- Use modern, well-supported technologies
- Follow best practices for chosen technology stack
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility where applicable

## Development Process

1. **Specify First**: Always create specifications before coding
2. **Review**: Review specifications before implementation
3. **Implement**: Code according to specifications
4. **Test**: Test against specifications
5. **Document**: Document any changes or deviations
